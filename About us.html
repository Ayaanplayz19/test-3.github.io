When little boy Ayaan Gazali was first introduced to E commerce he always wanted to make his own website he first started earning money by selling these pens to his friends he earned a decent amount of money to cover his cost price but to his shock he earned enough money for him to buy his own domain name for 2 years by that time he was 10 years old and started making his own website through plugins and some free templates for his websites but unfortunately  he was learning how to make his website without an educator he struggled to make his website as good as possible but he did not achieve what he was trying to achieve and discontinued to create his website.He started learning programming languages like block coding Javascript ,python over a period of 1 year when his summer vacations arrived he was eager to learn the language of HTML and asked his parents to put him for HTML class Which was the first time Ayaan Gazali's parents paid money to an educator for coding and learnt the language of HTML so he started developing his first E-commerce websitef
